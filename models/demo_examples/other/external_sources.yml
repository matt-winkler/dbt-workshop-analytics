#
#  Do you have data in S3? Do you want to access this data within Snowflake from dbt?
#  Well you can, with the dbt-external-tables package!
#
#  GUIDE
#
#  (1) Create Snowflake external stages, e.g.,:
#
#       use database analytics;
#       use schema <your dev or prod schema>;
#       create or replace stage s3_dbt_tutorial_public url='s3://dbt-tutorial-public/' file_format = (type=csv);
# 
#  (2) Add the dbt-external-tables package in packages.yml
# 
#  (3) Execute `dbt run-operation stage_external_sources` to create the external tables,
#      and to refresh them later. (Add this to your dbt Cloud Job.)
#
#  (4) Access the source data from dbt, e.g.,
#
#        select * from {{ source('jaffle_shop', 'customers') }}
# 
#  OTHER EXTERNAL TABLES
#
#  This package works with Snowpipes, GCS buckets, Redshift Spectrum tables, and more!
